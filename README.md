# RHO
R Programs and Tidbits for various purposes, some of which you would probably not expect to be executed in R.<br/>
NOTE I - These programs are not standalone ... If you cannot find something then please search the other documents.<br/>
NOTE II - All programs (docs) run in Base R unless the document contains a library() statement, in which you must library.<br/>
NOTE III - These R codes are original (unless stated in a document), however some (most) are transcribed from common implementations of algorithms written in other languages.
