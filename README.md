# RHO
R Programs and Tidbits for various purposes, some of which you would probably not expect to be executed in R.<br/>
NOTE I - These programs are not standalone ... If you cannot find something then please search the other documents.<br/>
NOTE II - All programs run in Base R unless the document containing the code contains a library statement, in which case you must library the packages.
